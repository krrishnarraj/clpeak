# Homebrew formula for clpeak — intended for Homebrew/homebrew-core.
#
# Copy this file to `Formula/c/clpeak.rb` in a homebrew-core PR (or a tap).
# Bump `tag` + `revision` on every release; `revision` is the full commit SHA
# the tag points at (git rev-parse <tag>).  Homebrew CI appends the `bottle do`
# block — do not add it by hand.
#
# Why a git URL instead of a release tarball: clpeak derives its version from
# `git describe` (src/common/cmake/version.cmake).  A GitHub source tarball has
# no .git, so the build would fall back to a stale hardcoded version.  Passing
# `tag:` makes Homebrew fetch that tag, so git-describe reports the real version.
