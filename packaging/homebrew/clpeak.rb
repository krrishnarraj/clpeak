# Why a git URL instead of a release tarball: clpeak derives its version from
# `git describe` (src/common/cmake/version.cmake).  A GitHub source tarball has
# no .git, so the build would fall back to a stale hardcoded version.  Passing
# `tag:` makes Homebrew fetch that tag, so git-describe reports the real version.
